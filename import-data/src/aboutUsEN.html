                Hi there! I'm Oleksandr Horondi, founder of the{' '}<span className={styles.horondi}>HORONDI</span>
                brand. I was born and grew up in Zakarpattia Oblast and, truth be told, the early 20 years of my life
                aren't always pleasant to recall or speak about. I had no one to look up to or be inspired by;
                no one taught me about the world, how to live in it and by what set of rules. Without any initial
                foundation of moral and spiritual values, I was an easily influenced teenager. Still, despite
                having done things I'm not proud of, I didn't consider myself a bad person. I just followed
                the lead of people around me, no questions asked.

              <Typography paragraph>
                However, somewhere deep inside, a real me was hiding to survive the environment I was growing up in.
                I've always wanted to believe that each of us has a special place in the world. A place where one
                can be filled with all colors of life, blossom like a spring flower blooms under the warm beams
                of the morning son, and bring joy to the people around. If the first «teacher» I met in my path
                were a much kinder one, who knows how it all would have turned out.

              <Typography paragraph>
                Be that as it may, I am grateful, for this road, bumpy as it was, has lead me here. It was a long
                journey, but this story has a happy ending, as I've managed to find myself and my craft. This pursuit
                brings joy to the people around me. It gets me out of bed in the morning. It motivates me to keep improving.

                Maybe I shouldn't have written all of that, as it's likely that you came here simply to buy an item
                that will serve you and bring joy for years to come. However,{' '}<span className={styles.horondi}>HORONDI</span>
                is not machine-made products from somewhere far abroad. <span className={styles.horondi}>HORONDI</span>
                is something more. Every item, be it a backpack, a wallet, or a bag, contains a sliver of my soul I've put
                in there to share it with people. There is nothing more precious to me in the whole world than an opportunity
                to bring a genuine smile to the faces of people around me and see joy in their eyes. That is why,
                when you buy{' '}<span className={styles.horondi}>HORONDI</span>, you give me this opportunity.
